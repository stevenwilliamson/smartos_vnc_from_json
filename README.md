smartos_vnc_from_json
=====================

OSX Service (context menu) to allow selected VNC info from "vmadm info" on SmartOS to launch a VNC session

Find it annoying to have to switch context to open a VNC client, the type in the host and port number to connect to your SmartOS VM ?

No More!

This OSX service launches a chicken VNC session from the highligted output of vmadm info.

It would be nice to use the default OSX VNC client but it hangs when attempting to connect to the SmartOS Qemu VNC server.
